    <div class="types"><p>1. Strength Training</p></div>
    <div class="captions">Strength training is an important way to improve mobility and overall functioning,
        particularly as you get older. “As you age, you lose muscle mass, which can have a significant
        impact on the quality of life. Strength exercises build bones and muscle, and more muscle protects
        your body from falls and the fractures that can happen in older age,” says Robert Sallis, MD, a family
        medicine doctor at Kaiser Permanente in Fontana, California, and chairman of the Exercise Is Medicine initiative
        with the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM).</div>
    
    <div class="types"><p>2.  Aerobic (Cardiovascular) Exercise</p></div>
    <div class="captions">Aerobic exercise is the foundation of every fitness program — and 
        for good reason. Also called cardiovascular exercise or cardio, this type of physical 
        activity increases your heart rate and breathing rate, which improves your cardiorespiratory
         fitness, according to the American Heart Association. </div>

    <div class="equipment-heading">What You Should Know About Home Gym Equipment</div>
    <div class="equipment">Exercising at home means you get to skip the commute to the gym, and you won’t have to wait for someone else to finish up on the machine you want to use. You get to work out whenever it fits into your schedule.

        One positive outcome of the pandemic is that there are now so many more online resources for exercise programs, says Smith-Ryan. Many of those programs require no equipment at all and can be easily done with a small amount of floor space.
        
        If you are just starting out, she says that simple body-weight exercises (squats, lunges, pushups) can help build muscle during resistance training. Consider investing in a yoga or exercise mat, so that you can easily do floor exercises. After that, consider collecting resistance bands or a set of dumbbells to up the intensity of strength training.
        
        What you choose will depend on your preferences, budget, and the space available in your home. For instance, a set of resistance bands is cheap and can be stored easily. But know that you can get in a good sweat session without a lot of equipment and without having to spend a lot of money.</div>
